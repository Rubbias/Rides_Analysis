Questions : 1.	What key metric(s) would you propose to monitor over time to measure the success of the team's efforts in improving Drivers’ engagement and why? Clearly define your metric(s) and present calculations showing trends or patterns as you see appropriate. 2.	Can you help us identify which factors are associated with better engagement? What segments are doing well and what could be improved? Can you propose any recommendations (business initiatives or product changes) that could address these opportunities?

FINDINGS : Taxi service is making a contribution of 77% higher than PHV service. Marketing campaigns played a key role in driver’s engagement. No Private Hire Vehicle (PHV) service in Spain. Ride volume in April fell below the overall monthly average. Failed to appropriately recognize and reward top-performing riders, potentially impacting their motivation. Multiple passenger cancellation after bookings is also a cause. PHV drivers are top riders compared to taxi drivers.

SUGGESTIONS : Optimise marketing campaigns and reduce the redundant emails, which will tend unsubscribe drivers as well to opt for email campaign. Maintain acceptance rate by drivers and reduce cancellations. PHV segment needed to be improved and target the implementation of PHV  in Spain, as taxi service exist, introducing Private Hire Vehicles (PHVs) will be relatively straightforward. Conversion of Taxi drivers to PHV by reducing the company's commission can incentivize taxi drivers to become PHV drivers, as PHV driving often offers higher earnings than traditional taxi driving. This benefits both the company (monopoly in the market) and the drivers (increased income).
